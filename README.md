# traffic-assignment

Given a network transportation, this code computes two Wardrop Equilibrium, one based on density of cars in each arc of the network (the density is the quantity of 
cars taken in an instant divided by the length of the arc), the other one based on flow of vehicles of cars as classical. The approach based on density allows 
for more realistic cost functions. 



Transport1.m , Transport2.m , Transport3.m , Transport4.m , Transport5.m : different configuration of the traffic network.
